Installation
============

How To Get the Latest Version
-----------------------------

We recommend using the ``mamba`` package manager, which is a C++ reimplementation of ``conda``.
It can be found `here <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`_.

To install ``radionets`` and it's dependencies from the environment file, use:

.. code-block:: console

  $ mamba env create -f environment.yml
