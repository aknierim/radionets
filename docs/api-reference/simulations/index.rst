.. currentmodule:: radionets.simulations

Functions to simulate and illustrate radio interferometric observations.
At the moment simulations based on the MNIST dataset and simulations of
Gaussian sources are possible. We are currently working on simulating
visibilities directly in Fourier space. For more information, visit our
corresponding repository `pyvisgen <https://github.com/radionets-project/pyvisgen>`_.
In the future, the simulations will be created using the `pyvisgen` repository,
while the `radionets` repository contains the training and evaluation methods.
